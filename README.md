**Description:** 

Key Ideas: socket programming, multithreading, and routing, system programming
Language: C/C++
Tools: Linux/Unix, Ubuntu (via AWS)

Successfully implemented:
- Through programming exercises (written in C++), a simple web service and a simple web client
- Through multithreaded programming exercises (written in C++), how to throttle and control data rates when transferring data across the Internet
- Through multithreaded programming exercises (written in C++), how to implement link layer functionalities so that nodes can be connected to each other and stay connected to form a network of nodes
- Through multithreaded programming exercises (written in C++), how to implement network layer functionalities (on top of a solid link layer) to route packets in a network of nodes
- Through multithreaded programming exercises (written in C++), how to implement transport layer functionalities (on top of a solid network layer) to reliably transfer data in a network of nodes
- Through multithreaded programming exercises (written in C++), how encapsulation works as a packet travels down the protocol stack and how decapsulation works as a packet travels up the protocol stack
- Through multithreaded programming exercises (written in C++), how threads within an application can communicate with each other safely and how to turn exteranl asynchronous events (such as a timer expiration) into synchronous message exchanges
